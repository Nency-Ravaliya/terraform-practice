In Terraform, **mutable** and **immutable** infrastructure refer to how infrastructure is managed and updated.

### 1. **Mutable Infrastructure**:
- **Definition**: Mutable infrastructure means that resources (like servers, databases, etc.) are **modified in place**. You update the existing infrastructure without replacing or recreating it.
  
- **How it works**: When you change a configuration in Terraform (like updating an instance size or adding storage), Terraform modifies the existing resource instead of creating a new one.
  
- **Example**: You have an EC2 instance running, and you want to change its instance type from `t2.micro` to `t2.small`. With mutable infrastructure, Terraform simply changes the size of the existing instance without destroying or recreating it.

- **Pros**:
  - Faster updates as existing infrastructure is reused.
  - No need to recreate or re-deploy services.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Risk of configuration drift (when changes made manually or by other systems are not tracked).
  - Higher chance of issues due to changes on the fly.

- **Simple Example**:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```
   If you change `t2.micro` to `t2.small`, Terraform will **update** the existing instance.

### 2. **Immutable Infrastructure**:
- **Definition**: Immutable infrastructure means that **resources are never modified** once they are created. If a change is needed, the existing resource is **replaced** with a new one.

- **How it works**: Instead of modifying an existing resource, Terraform destroys the current resource and creates a new one with the updated configuration. This ensures that no unwanted side effects from previous configurations are carried over.

- **Example**: You have an EC2 instance running, and you want to change its instance type from `t2.micro` to `t2.small`. With immutable infrastructure, Terraform destroys the existing instance and **creates a new one** with the updated instance type.

- **Pros**:
  - No configuration drift; every update creates a new, clean infrastructure.
  - Easier to troubleshoot issues since no existing infrastructure is modified.
  
- **Cons**:
  - Slower updates as resources need to be recreated.
  - Can be disruptive because resources are destroyed and recreated, leading to potential downtime.

- **Simple Example**:
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_launch_configuration" "example" {
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```
   If you change `t2.micro` to `t2.small`, Terraform will **destroy the old launch configuration** and create a **new one** with the updated instance type.

### Real-Life Example:

1. **Mutable**: You have a web server (EC2 instance). You want to increase the disk size. With mutable infrastructure, Terraform will modify the disk size on the existing instance without replacing it.

2. **Immutable**: You have a web server. You want to switch from a smaller server to a larger one. With immutable infrastructure, Terraform will **create a new server** and destroy the old one.

---

### Summary:

- **Mutable Infrastructure**: Changes are made to the existing infrastructure (in place updates). Easier but riskier due to potential drift or corruption over time.
  
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: New resources are created for every change, ensuring a clean slate each time, though this can be slower and more disruptive.

Immutable infrastructure is often preferred for production environments to ensure consistency, while mutable is useful for development or rapid changes.
